sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: When the file is sorted the algorithm takes almost the same time as the merge sort but with the other files the time is much bigger.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Is the most efficient with lowers execution times than the others moreover the execution time is bigger with the files in reverse order because the algorithm has to sort more values.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:  The execution time on this algorithm is identical no matter the file to be sorted what indicates that the algorithm takes the same number of steps.
